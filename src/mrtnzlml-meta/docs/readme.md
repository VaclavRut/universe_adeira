What is this? I believe that it's generally very difficult to understand and read other people _correctly_. I hide and filter many things publicly and change my opinions frequently. Others do it as well. This README should help you to understand some basic stones about me.

I am a JavaScript developer at [Pipedrive.com](https://www.pipedrive.com/), originally from Czech Republic üá®üáø. Currently, I work with technologies around **GraphQL**, **Relay**, **Flow/TS**, **React (Native)** and similar. I studied very different things and my main interests are also somewhere else, however, this brings me some financial security, so I invest a lot of energy into it. Eventually, I'd like to stop being a programmer.

## My location

I am officially part of Prague office and I spend most of my time here. I am basically never in Tallinn HQ. I used to [travel a lot](https://nomadlist.com/@mrtnzlml) (and still sometimes do) and therefore, I prefer solving every issue remotely if possible. I really enjoy being in different timezone so I can have time for some actual work and life. Do not expect I will react immediately. Do not expect it even when I am in the same city. I do not expect it as well.

## My day

As you can see below, I live in a natural timezone even when I am in the same city. It's because I wake up very early to get more out of my short day.

```json
{
  "Monday - Friday": {
    "5:00 - 5:20": "Reading üìì",
    "5:20 - 5:40": "Morning routine üöø",
    "5:40 - 6:00": "Breakfast üç≥",
    "6:00 - 15:00": "Work üë®‚Äçüíª",
    "...": "...",
    "22:00": "Time so sleep (to get full 7 hours) üò¥"
  },
  "...": "..."
}
```

I usually eat my lunch later (13:00). It's a habit a got in Latin America and I like it. I prefer to eat alone when I can since it's the only time I have for myself. This is the reason why I am most probably not going to attend some late meetings - I am already far away doing something else.

## Meetings, Slack

I genuinely don't like meetings. Luckily, I don't have that many of them. I am trying to attend only valuable ones. Please, always **prepare an agenda** for the meeting in advance so we can prepare well. I dislike when I am leaving the meeting without clear outcome and I feel like I just wasted my time there. Outcome from every meeting should be written somewhere. Wanna chat? Let's do it during coffee break instead! Do you prefer a walk outside? Event better! :)

Very similar rules applies to how I use Slack. I read everything relevant for me and I am leaving and joining channels frequently (depending on my needs and interests). Don't take it personally when I leave the channel. I prefer when you write me personally.

I might write you on weekends or outside of working hours. I do not expect you to react before you returned to work and you have time for it. Feel free to do the same.

I dislike unnecessary `@channel` and `@here` mentions in the public messages. Always think whether your message is so important to interrupt my (or any other colleagues') flow.

## Miscellaneous

_I am an introvert._ That means I loose energy when I am around other people for too long and I recharge my energy by spending time alone. Sounds weird? Check this video to understand my view: [https://www.reddit.com/93u8rj/](https://www.reddit.com/93u8rj/)

_I am a [volatile developer](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/stables-and-volatiles/)._ I like to solve any problem in an untraditional way and I prefer product development over development for clients. Definitely [read this article](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/stables-and-volatiles/) to understand what I mean by being volatile. It's very important. Here is an excerpt from the article. Volatiles are the engineers who:

- Prefer to define strategy rather than follow it.
- Have issues with authority and often have legitimate arguments for anarchy.
- Can‚Äôt conceive of failing, and seek a thrill in risk.
- See working with others as time-consuming and onerous tasks, prefer to work in small, autonomous groups, and don‚Äôt give a shit how you feel.
- Often don‚Äôt build particularly beautiful or stable things, but they sure do build a lot.
- Are only reliable if it‚Äôs in their best interest.
- Leave a trail of disruption in their wake.

_I like changes._ I like to do rapid and unexpected changes even though they are big. Sometimes it's my way of escaping stereotype, sometimes it's my way of saying "enough". And sometimes it's a result of understanding something better.

_I love when people do a great job._ You wouldn't believe how many hours I spent reading code of excellent programmers. Or how many hours I spent trying to understand some engineering marvels. I will definitely let you know when I love what you do.

_I hate when people do a bad job._ Especially developers! We tend to write a shitty code full of bugs, WTF, workarounds and then we are not even embarrassed to say that programming is an art. Nope. Can you imagine a plumber or construction worker to do the same?

_I work hard._ Doesn't matter on what. I want to be better than others. I want to understand things deeply and do them well. It's my personal choice. In case you see decrease in my performance then be sure I lost my motivation or I don't see the point anymore. I am probably working hard on something else already.

_I will not agree blindly._ I always questioned everything. Don't try to convince me about something blindly - it won't work unless I understand it and agree with it. Good way how to convince me is to explain the things reasonably and give me some time for my personal research. I am OK to do 180 turn when I see it's the right way.

_Success motivates me._ I feel energized when I have the opportunity to do something awesome. I feel miserable when I do not have the opportunity and I am treated just like a monkey or being ignored. Don't waste my potential.

TODO: what should the external people do when they get into the situation?
_I have my moods._ I am fine one minute and then can suddenly turn into a completely different person. I think it's related to my introversion when things simply went too far too quickly. I am working on that.

_I don't like to be bored._ Did I suddenly disappear? Did I leave the meeting? I was probably bored or didn't see the point.

TODO: similar
_I have my focus zone._ Usually, when I am working really hard. I can be in this zone for a long time (hours). And I need some time to get back. I am usually not very friendly during this recovery period because I am still partially in the zone. I am trying to learn how to switch these mods more quickly. Be patient with me, please.

_I want to have things under control._ This way I do things really well. It gives me possibility to say NO when I think it's not OK or to do sudden changes. I am very unhappy when someone treats me as yet another programmer-monkey or when I cannot say NO.

_I remember a lot._ Unfortunately. Unfulfilled promises or decisions are especially dangerous for me because I remember them and it makes me feel weird when they are simply forgotten. I hear "what was the point then". Let's not waste our time.

_I hate stupid people._ Violent people, people selling (or using) drugs, people with WTF opinions, racists, people begging on the street while doing nothing. I do not like smokers, religious people and bad drivers.
