## Enums

:::note
This is an old way how to write enums in Flow before actual [native enums](https://flow.org/en/docs/enums/) were supported. It's still probably going to work, but it's a legacy pattern and there are better ways now.
:::

```js
const Enum = Object.freeze({
  X: 'x',
  Y: 'y',
});

type EnumT = $Values<typeof Enum>;
('a': EnumT);
```

Results in:

```text
7: ('a': EnumT);
    ^ Cannot cast `'a'` to `EnumT` because string [1] is incompatible with enum [2].
   References:
   7: ('a': EnumT);
       ^ [1]
   7: ('a': EnumT);
            ^ [2]
```

See:

- https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/369e1f93dde1ddafec7c5539a20e7b061672da6c/tests/values/object_types.js

Please note: this only works when you define the object with values inside `Object.freeze`. Similar but alternative approach: https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/627#issuecomment-389668600

## Types-first architecture

:::note
Support for Classic mode has been dropped and Types-First mode is now always enabled (Types-First has been the default mode since v0.134). The `types_first` and `well_formed_exports` flowconfig options are no longer recognized. See https://medium.com/flow-type/types-first-a-scalable-new-architecture-for-flow-3d8c7ba1d4eb/ for more about Types-First mode.

Types-first is a new architecture which significantly improves the overall performance. It requires a bunch more type annotations (which is why it wasn't recommended widely yet) but it's production-ready and everything is way faster if you add the needed type annotations. You can enable it like so:

```ini
[options]
experimental.well_formed_exports=true
experimental.types_first=true
```

It requires that every exported type be annotated and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone starting a new project in Flow.

> The reason we needed to get the enforcement right for input positions in 0.85 was to enable things like flow autofix to actually be able to infer types. With the input annotations we can infer the output ones and insert them via a codemod!

You can codeshift the codebase like so (see: https://flow.org/en/docs/cli/annotate-exports/; manual changes recommended):

```text
flow codemod annotate-exports \
  --write \
  --repeat \
  --log-level info \
  /path/to/folder \
  2> out.log
```

It is better to migrate the codebase gradually step by step like so:

```ini
experimental.types_first=false
experimental.well_formed_exports=true
experimental.well_formed_exports.includes=<PROJECT_ROOT>/src/packages/js
experimental.well_formed_exports.includes=<PROJECT_ROOT>/src/packages/relay
; ...
```

_Q_: How your FB colleagues accepted the types-first migration? It sometimes feels quite controversial :grimacing: Maybe some article would be nice - are you planning it?<br/>
_A_: some people were a little bit grumpy about the additional annotation burden at first, but everyone seems to be used to it now and there wasn't any real pushback, it was mostly just some grumbling here and there

Thanks to Flow team for a great insights on this topic!
