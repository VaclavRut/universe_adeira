## Relay Config (`relay.config.js`)

:::note
This is no longer valid for Relay version 13+ (with the new Rust Compiler). The new compiler still uses `relay.config.js` but the configuration works differently (especially in monorepos with multiple projects).
:::

Relay supports configuration via CLI but also via configuration files using official NPM package [`relay-config`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/relay-config). Configuration files work only when you install this package. Relay Config relies on [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) to do its bidding. Itâ€™s configured to load from:

- a `relay` key in `package.json`

```json
{
  "relay": {
    "src": "./src"
  }
}
```

- a `relay.config.json` file

```json
{
  "src": "./src"
}
```

- or a `relay.config.js` file

```js
module.exports = {
  src: './src',
};
```

It accepts all the same configuration as the CLI does. Additionally, when using the `relay.config.js` file, a configuration entry like the language plugin also accepts an actual function:

```js
const typescript = require('relay-compiler-language-typescript');

module.exports = {
  language: typescript,
};
```

In the future, other entries such as `persistedQueries` and `customScalars` could also be configured as such and allow for projec specific setup.

## RelayNetworkLogger

:::note
Old RelayNetworkLogger [was removed in Relay 7.0.0](https://github.com/facebook/relay/releases/tag/v7.0.0), and relay-runtime no longer exports createRelayNetworkLogger. This logger is being replaced with event based logging on the Environment which will allow us to have richer and more contextual events logged with more detail on what's going on. Wrapping the actual network request doesn't work well as some "requests" might never actually end up on the network when they can be fulfilled completely from the store.
:::

```js
import RelayNetworkLogger from 'relay-runtime/lib/RelayNetworkLogger';

import fetchFunction from './fetchFunction';
import subscribeFunction from './subscribeFunction';

const fetch = __DEV__ ? RelayNetworkLogger.wrapFetch(fetchFunction) : fetchFunction;

const subscribe = __DEV__ ? RelayNetworkLogger.wrapSubscribe(subscribeFunction) : subscribeFunction;

const network = Network.create(fetch, subscribe);
const source = new RecordSource();
const store = new Store(source);

const env = new Environment({
  network,
  store,
});

export default env;
```

## Relay Compiler WASM & NEON

:::note
As for now, we're not planning on further integration Relay compiler (rust version) with wasm/neon. See: https://github.com/facebook/relay/commit/eefeed15fd51b3042a15e93f0665a680fd8e31b2
