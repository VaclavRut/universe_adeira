Saved state allows you to save internal Flow state to your filesystem (`.flow.saved_state` filename is important):

```text
ðŸ’ƒ yarn flow save-state --root=. --out=.flow.saved_state
Asking server to create a saved-state file at `/project_root/.flow.saved_state`
Created saved-state file `/project_root/.flow.saved_state`
```

You also have to have `.flow.saved_state_file_changes` file with changed file in this format (absolute paths are fine as well):

```text
src/packages/eslint-config-kiwicom/index.js
src/packages/eslint-config-kiwicom/ourRules.js
```

Now, stop the Flow server and start it again like this:

```text
ðŸ’ƒ yarn flow start --saved-state-fetcher=local --saved-state-no-fallback
```

You should be able to see that saved state is being used from logs (logs without saved state):

You can see that there is already some improvement. It's very convenient to combine it with `--lazy` mode:

```text
ðŸ’ƒ yarn flow start --saved-state-fetcher=local --saved-state-no-fallback --lazy
```

```

That's a huge improvement (from original cold start 17s to cold start 3s). Don't forget to refocus the lazy mode in case of Flow server already running:

```text
ðŸ’ƒ flow force-recheck --focus --lazy --input-file=.flow.saved_state_file_changes
```
