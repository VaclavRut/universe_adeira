# Hi, I am Martin

_please note: this document is still WIP_

I am fullstack JavaScript dev at Kiwi.com. I do not have fixed team so I am usually somewhere around **GraphQL**, **React Native** or any other **React** project (Portalo at this moment).

## My location

I am officially part of Prague office but I like to spend time in Barcelona. I am basically never in Brno HQ. I also travel a lot and therefore, I prefer solving every issue remotely.

## Meetings, Slack

I genuinely don't like meetings. Don't take it personally when I reject the invitation or when I don't show up. I am visiting only meetings where I expect great value. I still do care - but I don't have to waste time on every meeting. And you should not do it as well.

Very similar rules applies to how I use Slack. I am following zero inbox philosophy and I read everything. Therefore I don't follow every channel and I am leaving and joining channels frequently (dependning on my needs and interests). Again, don't take it personally when I leave the channel. I still do care - just differently.

## My Kiwi.com timeline

I joined this company in April 2017 (my first PR was Apr 7)

1. I created first GraphQL proxy (still ongoing project)
2. I created Chatbot for our custommer support (discontinued)
3. I created first React Native application (still ongoing)
4. I joined internal Portalo project (current)
5. ??
