# Hi, I am Martin ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿

I am fullstack JavaScript developer at [Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com/en/). Currently, I work at [graphql.kiwi.com](https://graphql.kiwi.com/) project and internal **monorepo** infrastructure but I also help other teams with **GraphQL** in general, **Relay**, **Flow**, **React (Native)** or any other **JS** project.

## My location

I am officially part of Prague or Barcelona office but I currently live in Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½. I am basically never in Brno HQ. I used to [travel a lot](https://nomadlist.com/@mrtnzlml) (and still sometimes do) and therefore, I prefer solving every issue remotely if possible. I really enjoy being in different timezone so I can have time for some actual work and life. Do not expect I will react immediatelly. Do not expect it even when I am in the same city. I do not expect it as well.

## Meetings, Slack

I genuinely don't like meetings. Luckily, I don't have that many meetings. I am trying to attend only valuable ones. Please always prepare an agenda for the meeting in advance so we can prepare well. I dislike when I am leaving the meeting without clear outcome and I feel like I just wasted my time there. Outcome from every meeting should be written somewhere. Wanna chat? Let's do it during coffee break instead! :)

Very similar rules applies to how I use Slack. I read everything relevant for me and I am leaving and joining channels frequently (depending on my needs and interests). Don't take it personally when I leave the channel. I prefer when you write me personally.

## Miscellaneous

_I am an introvert._ That means I loose energy when I am around other people for too long and I recharge my energy by spending time alone. Sounds weird? Check this video to understand my view: https://www.reddit.com/93u8rj/

_I am a volatile developer._ I like to solve any problem in an untraditional way. I have difficulties to finish things completely though because there is probably something more interesting somewhere else. Development for clients is just not for me. ([_I just got bored, everybody out._](https://youtu.be/cPEnRb6aaS4))

_I love when people do great job._ You wouldn't believe how many hours I spent reading code of excelent programmers. I will definitelly let you know when I love what you do.

_I hate when people do shitty job._ Escpecially developers! They write shitty code full of bugs, WTF, workarounds and then they are not even embarassed to say that programming is an art. Jeez. Can you imagine a plumber or construction worker to do the same?

_Success motivates me._ I feel energized when I have the opportunity to do something awesome. I feel miserable when I do not have the opportunity and I am treated just like a monkey.

_I have my moods._ I am fine in one minute and then I am suddenly completely different person. I think it's related to my introversion when things simply went too far too quickly. I am working on that.

_I have my focus zone._ Usually, when I am working really hard. I can be in this zone for a long time (hours). And I need some time to get back. I am usually not very friendly during this recovery period because I am still partially in the zone. I am trying to learn how to switch these mods more quickly. Be patient with me, please.

_I want to have things under control._ This way I do things really well. Also, it gives me possibility to say NO when I think it's not OK. I am very unhappy when someone treats me as yet another programmer-monkey or when I cannot say NO.

_I hate stupid people._ Violent people, people selling (or using) drugs, people with WTF opinions, racists, people begging on the street while doing nothing. I do not like smokers, religious people and bad drivers.

_I am not always positive._ At least you know something is not OK... :)
