# Hi, I am Martin

_please note: this document is still WIP_

I am fullstack JavaScript dev at Kiwi.com. I do not have fixed team so I am usually somewhere around **GraphQL**, **React Native** or any other **React** project (Portalo at this moment).

## My location

I am officially part of Prague office but I like to spend time in Barcelona. I am basically never in Brno HQ. I also [travel a lot](https://nomadlist.com/@mrtnzlml) and therefore, I prefer solving every issue remotely.

## Meetings, Slack

I genuinely don't like meetings. I am trying to attend only valuable ones. Please always prepare an agenda for the meeting in advance so we can prepare well. Don't take it personally when I reject the invitation or when I don't show up.

Very similar rules applies to how I use Slack. I am following zero inbox philosophy and I read everything. Therefore I don't follow every channel and I am leaving and joining channels frequently (dependning on my needs and interests). Again, don't take it personally when I leave the channel.

## My Kiwi.com timeline

I joined this company in April 2017 (my first PR was Apr 7)

1. I created first [GraphQL proxy](https://github.com/kiwicom/graphql) (still ongoing project)
2. I created Chatbot for our custommer support (discontinued)
3. I created first [React Native application](https://github.com/kiwicom/mobile) (still ongoing)
4. I joined internal Portalo project (current)
5. ??
