See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/imul

```js
console.log(Math.imul(3, 4));
// expected output: 12

console.log(Math.imul(-5, 12));
// expected output: -60

console.log(Math.imul(0xffffffff, 5));
// expected output: -5

console.log(Math.imul(0xfffffffe, 5));
// expected output: -10
```

> The reason imul exists is because it is faster in only one (so far) circumstance: AsmJS. AsmJS allows for JIT-optimizers to more easily implement internal integers in JavaScript. Multiplying two numbers stored internally as integers (which is only possible with AsmJS) with imul is the only potential circumstance where Math.imul may prove performant in current browsers.
