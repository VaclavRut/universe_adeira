title: Should you use Node.js LTS or not?
tags: ['javascript']

> Node LTS is primarily aimed at enterprise use where there may be more resistance to frequent updates, extensive procurement procedures and lengthy test and quality requirements.

> Generally if you are able to keep up with the latest stable and future Node releases you should do so. These are stable and _production ready_ releases with excellent community support. Unstable and experimental functionality is kept behind build and runtime flags and should not affect your day to day operations.
