The Turbofish remains undefeated.

See: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f103b2969b0088953873dc1ac92eb3387c753596/src/test/ui/parser/bastion-of-the-turbofish.rs

```rust
// Beware travellers, lest you venture into waters callous and unforgiving,
// where hope must be abandoned, ere it is cruelly torn from you. For here
// stands the bastion of the Turbofish: an impenetrable fortress holding
// unshaking against those who would dare suggest the supererogation of the
// Turbofish.
//
// Once I was young and foolish and had the impudence to imagine that I could
// shake free from the coils by which that creature had us tightly bound. I
// dared to suggest that there was a better way: a brighter future, in which
// Rustaceans both new and old could be rid of that vile beast. But alas! In
// my foolhardiness my ignorance was unveiled and my dreams were dashed
// unforgivingly against the rock of syntactic ambiguity.
//
// This humble program, small and insignificant though it might seem,
// demonstrates that to which we had previously cast a blind eye: an ambiguity
// in permitting generic arguments to be provided without the consent of the
// Great Turbofish. Should you be so na√Øve as to try to revolt against its
// mighty clutches, here shall its wrath be indomitably displayed. This
// program must pass for all eternity: forever watched by the guardian angel
// which gave this beast its name, and stands fundamentally at odds with the
// impetuous rebellion against the Turbofish.
//
// My heart aches in sorrow, for I know I am defeated. Let this be a warning
// to all those who come after: for they too must overcome the impassible
// hurdle of defeating the great beast, championed by a resolute winged
// guardian.
//
// Here stands the Bastion of the Turbofish, a memorial to Anna Harren,
// Guardian Angel of these Hallowed Grounds. <3

// for context.

fn main() {
    let (the, guardian, stands, resolute) = ("the", "Turbofish", "remains", "undefeated");
    let _: (bool, bool) = (the<guardian, stands>(resolute));
}
```

Still unclear why is this code problematic? This explains the issue better: https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=415ae154471981ffe05b372c85b1e031

```rust
fn main() {
    let (oh, woe, is, me) = ("oh", "woe", "is", "me");

    // at first glance this looks like "oh" is a function
    // which is being called with 2 type args: "woe" & "is"
    // and being invoked with 1 arg: "me"
    // which obvs doesn't make any sense since we know these are all &str
    let _ = (oh<woe, is>(me));

    // after staring at it for a bit the outer parens aren't superfluous
    // but define a tuple, with the comma in the middle separate 2 tuple items.

    // the left tuple item is the result of comparing "oh" to "woe" which
    // results in a bool, and the same is true for the right tuple item,
    // although "me" is wrapped in superfluous parens just to be confusing.

    // here's it but more clearly formatted
    let _: (bool, bool) = (oh < woe, is > me);
}
```
